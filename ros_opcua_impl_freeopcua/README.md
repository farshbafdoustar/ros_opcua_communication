This package implements bindings for freeopcua - Open Source C++ OPC-UA Server and Client Library.

First you need to build FreeOpcUa with following commands (asume that you are in FreeOpcUa folder):

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

And change `FreeOpcUa_LIBRARIES` variable to be compatible with your environment.

Enjoy!
